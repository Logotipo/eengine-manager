# eengine-manager
This program for microcontroller STM32F103x (for Keil uVision IDE) which  
designed for manage brushless torque electirc motor of vector method.  
Project include two methods of PWM:  
> 1. Space vector PWM;  
> 2. Simple PWM.  
  
Note: I can`t give you sheematic of control board or/and amplifier.
